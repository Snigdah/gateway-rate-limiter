# 🚀 Distributed Rate Limiting System using Redis & Spring Cloud Gateway

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Below is the high-level architecture of the system (you can replace this with your own `draw.io` diagram):

**Components:**
1. **Spring Cloud Gateway** – Intercepts incoming requests and applies distributed rate limiting.
2. **Bucket4j** for rate-limiting logic  
3. **Redis** – Stores token bucket states to synchronize rate limits across gateways.
4. **Kafka** — topic(s) for configuration change events (durable, ordered propagation). 
5. **License Service** – A backend microservice used to demonstrate rate limiting.
6. **Clients** – Send API requests through the gateway.

## 🧠 Overview
Client-specific rate limit rules are defined per `clientId` and per endpoint.  
The **License Service** saves configuration data to the database and **publishes update events to Kafka** whenever limits or endpoints change.  
All **API Gateways** consume these Kafka events to automatically refresh their in-memory cache and update Bucket4j configurations without restart.  
The **Redis** backend stores the distributed Bucket4j token states, ensuring consistent rate limiting across multiple gateway instances in a clustered environment.


## ⚙️ Key Features

✅ Distributed rate limiting using **Bucket4j + Redis**  
✅ Works across multiple **API Gateway** instances  
✅ Supports both **per-user** and **per-route** rate-limiting rules  
✅ Fully **reactive** (non-blocking I/O) setup  
✅ Ready for **containerized deployment** with Docker Compose

## ⚙️ Why Kafka + DB + Redis?

- **DB**: durable source of truth, audit, versioning.  
- **Kafka**: reliable and replayable propagation of config changes to many consumers (gateways).  
- **Redis**: low-latency token state for global/consistent rate limits across gateway instances.

This hybrid approach gives you durability, low latency, and scalability.
